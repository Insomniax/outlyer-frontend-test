# Documentation:

## Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
#### - react-chartjs-2: used for the line chart.
#### - react-redux: used for the redux state management.
#### - redux-thunk: redux middleware
#### - whatwg-fetch: to make HTTP requests.
#### - http-proxy-middleware: for the proxy server
#### - enzyme, enzyme-adapter-react-16: for unit testing using enzyme
#### - redux-mock-store: mocking redux store in unit tests.

## Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
#### Approximately 20 hours were spent for the test.

## Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
#### I had enough time, despite that I would improve it using SASS to improve styling, saga middleware for more declarative side effects in the reducer.
#### I would add currency options for the user to select and check the bitcoin conversion.

## Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
#### I am proud of the organization, the chart itself since I find it difficult to implement.
#### There is a not so well-explained documentation so it took me some time to figure it out.

## Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
#### I spent most time with the chart, as I state above there is poor documentation.
#### Also the unit test took quite a lot of time since I am not familiar with it in React.

## Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
#### The test was very interesting as it combined a lot of challenges: chart, proxy-server, redux, unit testing.
#### The test could be improved by employing saga middleware and SASS for better organization of styling.
